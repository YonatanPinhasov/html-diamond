                    <p id="carat-explain">Carat is the unit of measurement for the physical weight of diamonds.
                         Carat weight has the most influence on diamond value.
                         Diamonds of different shapes may appear different sizes for the same carat weight.</p>

                    <p id="color-explain">The color of gem-quality diamonds occurs in many hues. 
                        In the range from colorless to light yellow or light brown. Colorless diamonds are the rarest. 
                        Other natural colors (blue, red, pink for example) are known as “fancy,”
                         and their color grading is different than from white colorless diamonds.</p>

                    <p id="cut-explain">Of all the 4Cs, diamond cut has the greatest effect on a diamond’s beauty.
                         In determining the quality of the cut, the diamond grader evaluates the cutter’s skill in the fashioning of the diamond.
                         The more precise the diamond is cut, the more captivating the diamond is to the eye.</p>
